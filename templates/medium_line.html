            Medium transmission line is defined as a transmission line with an effective length more than 80 km (50 miles) but less than 250 km (150 miles). Unlike a short transmission line, the line charging current of a medium transmission line is appreciable and hence the shunt capacitance must be considered (this is also the case for long transmission lines). This shunt capacitance is captured within the admittance (“Y”) of the ABCD circuit parameters.
            In case of a nominal Π representation (i.e. nominal pi model), the lumped series impedance is placed at the middle of the circuit whereas the shunt admittances are at the ends. As we can see from the diagram of the Π network below, the total lumped shunt admittance is divided into 2 equal halves, and each half with value Y ⁄ 2 is placed at both the sending and the receiving end while the entire circuit impedance is between the two.
