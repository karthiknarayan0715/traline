            A short transmission line is defined as a transmission line with an effective length less than 80 km (50 miles), or with a voltage less than 69 kV. Unlike medium transmission lines and long transmission lines, the line charging current is negligible, and hence the shunt capacitance can be ignored.
            For short length, the shunt capacitance of this type of line is neglected and other parameters like electrical resistance and inductor of these short lines are lumped, hence the equivalent circuit is represented as given below. Let’s draw the vector diagram for this equivalent circuit, taking receiving end current Ir as reference. The sending end and receiving end voltages make angle with that reference receiving end current, of φs and φr, respectively.
